# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
As a new data analyst at PyBer, python-based ride sharing app company, I was first tasked with performing an exploratory analysis on a large data file. The purpose of this project was to determined relationships between city types and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percent of total fares and drivers and riders per each city. After running the analyses, I then created various charts and graphs to tell the story of the data. After the initial analysis myself and co-worker Omar were tasked with running the current analysis to provide insight into ride-sharing data based on city type. In this report specifically we will be looking at drivers, riders, and fares are influenced by the type of city whether that be Rural, Suburban, or Urban. These findings can then be used by corporate to improve accessibility in areas that need it more and determine the affordability of the PyBer service.
