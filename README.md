# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
### Purpose
As a new data analyst at PyBer, python-based ride sharing app company, I was first tasked with performing an exploratory analysis on a large data file. The purpose of this project was to determined relationships between city types and the number of drivers and riders as well as the percent of total fares and drivers and riders per each city. After running the analyses, I then created various charts and graphs to tell the story of the data. After the initial analysis myself and co-worker Omar were tasked with running the current analysis to provide insight into ride-sharing data based on city type. In this report specifically we will be looking at drivers, riders, and fares are influenced by the type of city whether that be Rural, Suburban, or Urban. These findings can then be used by corporate to improve accessibility in areas that need it more and determine the affordability of the PyBer service. 
## Results
As seen in the summary DataFrame below the Urban city type surpassed all others in total rides, drivers, and fares. However due to an abundance of customers and drivers they also saw the lowest average fare for drivers and riders totaling $24.53 and $16.57.  

The second highest rates were seen in the Suburban city type with approximately 1,000 less riders and 2,000 less drivers than in the Urban sphere. However due to this lack of resources that inversely drives the price up for average fare per driver and rider up to $39.50 and $30.97. 

The city type that saw the lowest totals in rides, drivers, and fares was the rural type totaling a miniscule fraction of the other city types with only 125 total rides and 78 drivers. Again, as we saw in the Suburban city type this lack of resources created an even greater surge in the average fare per ride and driver. With the highest rates of $34.62 per ride and $55.49 per driver.
